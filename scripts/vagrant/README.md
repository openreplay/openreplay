ðŸ’¡ As of today, VirtualBox is not supported on Mac M1. You can try with VMWare as the Vagrant backend, but this has not been tested.

### To start developing

- [Frontend](../../frontend/development.md)
- [API](../../api/development.md)
- [Backend](../../backend/development.md)

### Notes

Itâ€™ll be a good practice to take a snapshot once the initial setup is complete, so that if something is not working as expected, you can always fall back to a stable known version.
```bash
cd openreplay-dev
vagrant snapshot save <openreplay-version-base>
# For example
vagrant snapshot save openreplay-160-base
```

```bash
# To restore the snapshot
cd openreplay-dev
vagrant snapshot restore openreplay-160-base
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ If the base VM is deleted, the snapshot wonâ€™t be available.
