# kube-prometheus-stack

Installs the [kube-prometheus stack](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus), a collection of Kubernetes manifests, [Grafana](http://grafana.com/) dashboards, and [Prometheus rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/) combined with documentation and scripts to provide easy to operate end-to-end Kubernetes cluster monitoring with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) using the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator).

See the [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) README for details about components, dashboards, and alerts.

_Note: This chart was formerly named `prometheus-operator` chart, now renamed to more clearly reflect that it installs the `kube-prometheus` project stack, within which Prometheus Operator is only one component._

## Prerequisites

$ helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
```

With Helm v3, CRDs created by this chart are not updated by default and should be manually updated.
Consult also the [Helm Documentation on CRDs](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions).

_See [helm upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for command documentation._

### Upgrading an existing Release to a new major version

A major chart version change (like v1.2.3 -> v2.0.0) indicates that there is an incompatible breaking change needing manual actions.

### From 11.x to 12.x

The chart was migrated to support only helm v3 and later.

### From 10.x to 11.x

Version 11 upgrades prometheus-operator from 0.42.x to 0.43.x. Starting with 0.43.x an additional `AlertmanagerConfigs` CRD is introduced. Helm does not automatically upgrade or install new CRDs on a chart upgrade, so you have to install the CRD manually before updating:

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/release-0.43/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_alertmanagerconfigs.yaml
```

Version 11 removes the deprecated tlsProxy via ghostunnel in favor of native TLS support the prometheus-operator gained with v0.39.0.

### From 9.x to 10.x

Version 10 upgrades prometheus-operator from 0.38.x to 0.42.x. Starting with 0.40.x an additional `Probes` CRD is introduced. Helm does not automatically upgrade or install new CRDs on a chart upgrade, so you have to install the CRD manually before updating:

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/release-0.42/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_probes.yaml
```

### From 8.x to 9.x

Version 9 of the helm chart removes the existing `additionalScrapeConfigsExternal` in favour of `additionalScrapeConfigsSecret`. This change lets users specify the secret name and secret key to use for the additional scrape configuration of prometheus. This is useful for users that have prometheus-operator as a subchart and also have a template that creates the additional scrape configuration.

### From 7.x to 8.x

Due to new template functions being used in the rules in version 8.x.x of the chart, an upgrade to Prometheus Operator and Prometheus is necessary in order to support them. First, upgrade to the latest version of 7.x.x

```console
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --version 7.5.0
```

Then upgrade to 8.x.x

```console
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --version [8.x.x]
```

Minimal recommended Prometheus version for this chart release is `2.12.x`

### From 6.x to 7.x

Due to a change in grafana subchart, version 7.x.x now requires Helm >= 2.12.0.

### From 5.x to 6.x

Due to a change in deployment labels of kube-state-metrics, the upgrade requires `helm upgrade --force` in order to re-create the deployment. If this is not done an error will occur indicating that the deployment cannot be modified:

```console
invalid: spec.selector: Invalid value: v1.LabelSelector{MatchLabels:map[string]string{"app.kubernetes.io/name":"kube-state-metrics"}, MatchExpressions:[]v1.LabelSelectorRequirement(nil)}: field is immutable
```

If this error has already been encountered, a `helm history` command can be used to determine which release has worked, then `helm rollback` to the release, then `helm upgrade --force` to this new one

## Configuration

See [Customizing the Chart Before Installing](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing). To see all configurable options with detailed comments:

```console
helm show values prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
```

You may also `helm show values` on this chart's [dependencies](#dependencies) for additional options.

### Multiple releases

The same chart can be used to run multiple Prometheus instances in the same cluster if required. To achieve this, it is necessary to run only one instance of prometheus-operator and a pair of alertmanager pods for an HA configuration, while all other components need to be disabled. To disable a dependency during installation, set `kubeStateMetrics.enabled`, `nodeExporter.enabled` and `grafana.enabled` to `false`.

## Work-Arounds for Known Issues

### Running on private GKE clusters

When Google configure the control plane for private clusters, they automatically configure VPC peering between your Kubernetes clusterâ€™s network and a separate Google managed project. In order to restrict what Google are able to access within your cluster, the firewall rules configured restrict access to your Kubernetes pods. This means that in order to use the webhook component with a GKE private cluster, you must configure an additional firewall rule to allow the GKE control plane access to your webhook pod.

You can read more information on how to add firewall rules for the GKE control plane nodes in the [GKE docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters#add_firewall_rules)

Alternatively, you can disable the hooks by setting `prometheusOperator.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false`.

## PrometheusRules Admission Webhooks

With Prometheus Operator version 0.30+, the core Prometheus Operator pod exposes an endpoint that will integrate with the `validatingwebhookconfiguration` Kubernetes feature to prevent malformed rules from being added to the cluster.

### How the Chart Configures the Hooks

A validating and mutating webhook configuration requires the endpoint to which the request is sent to use TLS. It is possible to set up custom certificates to do this, but in most cases, a self-signed certificate is enough. The setup of this component requires some more complex orchestration when using helm. The steps are created to be idempotent and to allow turning the feature on and off without running into helm quirks.

1. A pre-install hook provisions a certificate into the same namespace using a format compatible with provisioning using end-user certificates. If the certificate already exists, the hook exits.
2. The prometheus operator pod is configured to use a TLS proxy container, which will load that certificate.
3. Validating and Mutating webhook configurations are created in the cluster, with their failure mode set to Ignore. This allows rules to be created by the same chart at the same time, even though the webhook has not yet been fully set up - it does not have the correct CA field set.
4. A post-install hook reads the CA from the secret created by step 1 and patches the Validating and Mutating webhook configurations. This process will allow a custom CA provisioned by some other process to also be patched into the webhook configurations. The chosen failure policy is also patched into the webhook configurations

### Alternatives

It should be possible to use [jetstack/cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) if a more complete solution is required, but it has not been tested.

### Limitations

Because the operator can only run as a single pod, there is potential for this component failure to cause rule deployment failure. Because this risk is outweighed by the benefit of having validation, the feature is enabled by default.

## Developing Prometheus Rules and Grafana Dashboards

This chart Grafana Dashboards and Prometheus Rules are just a copy from [prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator) and other sources, synced (with alterations) by scripts in [hack](hack) folder. In order to introduce any changes you need to first [add them to the original repo](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus/blob/master/docs/developing-prometheus-rules-and-grafana-dashboards.md) and then sync there by scripts.

## Further Information

For more in-depth documentation of configuration options meanings, please see

- [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)
- [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/grafana#grafana-helm-chart)

## prometheus.io/scrape

The prometheus operator does not support annotation-based discovery of services, using the `PodMonitor` or `ServiceMonitor` CRD in its place as they provide far more configuration options.
For information on how to use PodMonitors/ServiceMonitors, please see the documentation on the `prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator` documentation here:

- [ServiceMonitors](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/user-guides/getting-started.md#include-servicemonitors)
- [PodMonitors](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/user-guides/getting-started.md#include-podmonitors)
- [Running Exporters](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/user-guides/running-exporters.md)

By default, Prometheus discovers PodMonitors and ServiceMonitors within its namespace, that are labeled with the same release tag as the prometheus-operator release.
Sometimes, you may need to discover custom PodMonitors/ServiceMonitors, for example used to scrape data from third-party applications.
An easy way of doing this, without compromising the default PodMonitors/ServiceMonitors discovery, is allowing Prometheus to discover all PodMonitors/ServiceMonitors within its namespace, without applying label filtering.
To do so, you can set `prometheus.prometheusSpec.podMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues` and `prometheus.prometheusSpec.serviceMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues` to `false`.

## Migrating from stable/prometheus-operator chart

## Zero downtime

Since `kube-prometheus-stack` is fully compatible with the `stable/prometheus-operator` chart, a migration without downtime can be achieved.
However, the old name prefix needs to be kept. If you want the new name please follow the step by step guide below (with downtime).

You can override the name to achieve this:

```console
helm upgrade prometheus-operator prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -n monitoring --reuse-values --set nameOverride=prometheus-operator
```

**Note**: It is recommended to run this first with `--dry-run --debug`.

## Redeploy with new name (downtime)

If the **prometheus-operator** values are compatible with the new **kube-prometheus-stack** chart, please follow the below steps for migration:

> The guide presumes that chart is deployed in `monitoring` namespace and the deployments are running there. If in other namespace, please replace the `monitoring` to the deployed namespace.

1. Patch the PersistenceVolume created/used by the prometheus-operator chart to `Retain` claim policy:

    ```console
    kubectl patch pv/<PersistentVolume name> -p '{"spec":{"persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy":"Retain"}}'
    ```

    **Note:** To execute the above command, the user must have a cluster wide permission. Please refer [Kubernetes RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)

2. Uninstall the **prometheus-operator** release and delete the existing PersistentVolumeClaim, and verify PV become Released.

    ```console
    helm uninstall prometheus-operator -n monitoring
    kubectl delete pvc/<PersistenceVolumeClaim name> -n monitoring
    ```

    Additionally, you have to manually remove the remaining `prometheus-operator-kubelet` service.

    ```console
    kubectl delete service/prometheus-operator-kubelet -n kube-system
    ```

    You can choose to remove all your existing CRDs (ServiceMonitors, Podmonitors, etc.) if you want to.

3. Remove current `spec.claimRef` values to change the PV's status from Released to Available.

    ```console
    kubectl patch pv/<PersistentVolume name> --type json -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/claimRef"}]' -n monitoring
    ```

**Note:** To execute the above command, the user must have a cluster wide permission. Please refer to [Kubernetes RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)

After these steps, proceed to a fresh **kube-prometheus-stack** installation and make sure the current release of **kube-prometheus-stack** matching the `volumeClaimTemplate` values in the `values.yaml`.

The binding is done via matching a specific amount of storage requested and with certain access modes.

For example, if you had storage specified as this with **prometheus-operator**:

```yaml
volumeClaimTemplate:
  spec:
    storageClassName: gp2
    accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
    resources:
     requests:
       storage: 50Gi
```

You have to specify matching `volumeClaimTemplate` with 50Gi storage and `ReadWriteOnce` access mode.

Additionally, you should check the current AZ of your legacy installation's PV, and configure the fresh release to use the same AZ as the old one. If the pods are in a different AZ than the PV, the release will fail to bind the existing one, hence creating a new PV.

This can be achieved either by specifying the labels through `values.yaml`, e.g. setting `prometheus.prometheusSpec.nodeSelector` to:

```yaml
nodeSelector:
  failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone: east-west-1a
```

or passing these values as `--set` overrides during installation.

The new release should now re-attach your previously released PV with its content.

## Migrating from coreos/prometheus-operator chart

The multiple charts have been combined into a single chart that installs prometheus operator, prometheus, alertmanager, grafana as well as the multitude of exporters necessary to monitor a cluster.

There is no simple and direct migration path between the charts as the changes are extensive and intended to make the chart easier to support.

The capabilities of the old chart are all available in the new chart, including the ability to run multiple prometheus instances on a single cluster - you will need to disable the parts of the chart you do not wish to deploy.

You can check out the tickets for this change [here](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues/592) and [here](https://github.com/helm/charts/pull/6765).

### High-level overview of Changes

#### Added dependencies

The chart has added 3 [dependencies](#dependencies).

- Node-Exporter, Kube-State-Metrics: These components are loaded as dependencies into the chart, and are relatively simple components
- Grafana: The Grafana chart is more feature-rich than this chart - it contains a sidecar that is able to load data sources and dashboards from configmaps deployed into the same cluster. For more information check out the [documentation for the chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/grafana)

#### Kubelet Service

Because the kubelet service has a new name in the chart, make sure to clean up the old kubelet service in the `kube-system` namespace to prevent counting container metrics twice.

#### Persistent Volumes

If you would like to keep the data of the current persistent volumes, it should be possible to attach existing volumes to new PVCs and PVs that are created using the conventions in the new chart. For example, in order to use an existing Azure disk for a helm release called `prometheus-migration` the following resources can be created:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pvc-prometheus-migration-prometheus-0
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  azureDisk:
    cachingMode: None
    diskName: pvc-prometheus-migration-prometheus-0
    diskURI: /subscriptions/f5125d82-2622-4c50-8d25-3f7ba3e9ac4b/resourceGroups/sample-migration-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/pvc-prometheus-migration-prometheus-0
    fsType: ""
    kind: Managed
    readOnly: false
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete
  storageClassName: prometheus
  volumeMode: Filesystem
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  labels:
    app: prometheus
    prometheus: prometheus-migration-prometheus
  name: prometheus-prometheus-migration-prometheus-db-prometheus-prometheus-migration-prometheus-0
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: prometheus
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  volumeName: pvc-prometheus-migration-prometheus-0
```

The PVC will take ownership of the PV and when you create a release using a persistent volume claim template it will use the existing PVCs as they match the naming convention used by the chart. For other cloud providers similar approaches can be used.

#### KubeProxy

The metrics bind address of kube-proxy is default to `127.0.0.1:10249` that prometheus instances **cannot** access to. You should expose metrics by changing `metricsBindAddress` field value to `0.0.0.0:10249` if you want to collect them.

Depending on the cluster, the relevant part `config.conf` will be in ConfigMap `kube-system/kube-proxy` or `kube-system/kube-proxy-config`. For example:

```console
kubectl -n kube-system edit cm kube-proxy
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  config.conf: |-
    apiVersion: kubeproxy.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
    kind: KubeProxyConfiguration
    # ...
    # metricsBindAddress: 127.0.0.1:10249
    metricsBindAddress: 0.0.0.0:10249
    # ...
  kubeconfig.conf: |-
    # ...
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    app: kube-proxy
  name: kube-proxy
  namespace: kube-system
```
