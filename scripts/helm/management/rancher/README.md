# Rancher

***Rancher*** is open source software that combines everything an organization needs to adopt and run containers in production. Built on Kubernetes, Rancher makes it easy for DevOps teams to test, deploy and manage their applications.

### Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Rancher Server](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/k8s-install/) on a Kubernetes cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh/) package manager. For a Rancher Supported Deployment please follow our [HA install instructions](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/how-ha-works/).


### Prerequisites Details

*For installations covered under [Rancher Support SLA](https://rancher.com/support-maintenance-terms/) the target cluster must be **[RKE](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/k8s-install/kubernetes-rke/)** or **[K3s](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/k8s-install/kubernetes-rke/)**.*

Make sure the node(s) for the Rancher server fulfill the following requirements:

[Operating Systems and Docker Requirements](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/requirements#operating-systems-and-docker-requirements)
[Hardware Requirements](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/requirements/#hardware-requirements)

- [CPU and Memory](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/requirements/#cpu-and-memory)
- [CPU and Memory for Rancher prior to v2.4.0](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/requirements/#cpu-and-memory-for-rancher-prior-to-v2-4-0)
- [Disks](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/requirements/#disks)

- [Node IP Addresses](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/requirements/#node-ip-addresses)
- [Port Requirements](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/requirements/#port-requirements)

[Install the Required CLI Tools](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/k8s-install/helm-rancher/#1-install-the-required-cli-tools)

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl) - Kubernetes command-line tool.
- [helm](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm) - Package management for Kubernetes. Refer to the [Helm version requirements](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/options/helm-version) to choose a version of Helm to install Rancher.

For a list of best practices that we recommend for running the Rancher server in production, refer to the [best practices section](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/best-practices/deployment-types/).

## Installing Rancher

For production environments, we recommend installing Rancher in a [high-availability Kubernetes installation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/how-ha-works/) so that your user base can always access Rancher Server. When installed in a Kubernetes cluster, Rancher will integrate with the cluster’s etcd database and take advantage of Kubernetes scheduling for high-availability.

Optional: Installing Rancher on a [Single-node](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/k8s-install/#optional-installing-rancher-on-a-single-node-kubernetes-cluster) Kubernetes Cluster

#### Add the Helm Chart Repository

Use [helm repo add](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo_add/) command to add the Helm chart repository that contains charts to install Rancher. For more information about the repository choices and which is best for your use case, see Choosing a Version of Rancher.

```bash
helm repo add rancher-latest https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest
```

#### Create a Namespace for Rancher

We’ll need to define a Kubernetes namespace where the resources created by the Chart should be installed. This should always be cattle-system:

```bash
kubectl create namespace cattle-system
```

#### Choose your SSL Configuration

The Rancher management server is designed to be secure by default and requires SSL/TLS configuration.

There are three recommended options for the source of the certificate used for TLS termination at the Rancher server:

- [Rancher-generated TLS certificate](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/k8s-install/helm-rancher/#4-choose-your-ssl-configuration)
- [Let’s Encrypt](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/k8s-install/helm-rancher/#4-choose-your-ssl-configuration)
- [Bring your own certificate](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/k8s-install/helm-rancher/#4-choose-your-ssl-configuration)

#### Install cert-manager

This step is only required to use certificates issued by Rancher’s generated CA **`(ingress.tls.source=rancher)`** or to request Let’s Encrypt issued certificates **`(ingress.tls.source=letsEncrypt)`**.

[These instructions are adapted from the official cert-manager documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/k8s-install/helm-rancher/#5-install-cert-manager)

#### Install Rancher with Helm and Your Chosen Certificate Option

- [Rancher to generated certificates](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/k8s-install/helm-rancher/#6-install-rancher-with-helm-and-your-chosen-certificate-option)
```bash
helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.my.org

# Wait for Rancher to be rolled out
kubectl -n cattle-system rollout status deploy/rancher
Waiting for deployment "rancher" rollout to finish: 0 of 3 updated replicas are available...
deployment "rancher" successfully rolled out
```

- [Let’s Encrypt](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/k8s-install/helm-rancher/#6-install-rancher-with-helm-and-your-chosen-certificate-option)
  
```bash
helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.my.org \
  --set ingress.tls.source=letsEncrypt \
  --set letsEncrypt.email=me@example.org

# Wait for Rancher to be rolled out
kubectl -n cattle-system rollout status deploy/rancher
Waiting for deployment "rancher" rollout to finish: 0 of 3 updated replicas are available...
deployment "rancher" successfully rolled out
```

- [Certificates from Files](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/k8s-install/helm-rancher/#6-install-rancher-with-helm-and-your-chosen-certificate-option)

```bash
helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.my.org \
  --set ingress.tls.source=secret
```

*If you are using a Private CA signed certificate , add **--set privateCA=true** to the command:`*

```bash
helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.my.org \
  --set ingress.tls.source=secret \
  --set privateCA=true

# Wait for Rancher to be rolled out
kubectl -n cattle-system rollout status deploy/rancher
Waiting for deployment "rancher" rollout to finish: 0 of 3 updated replicas are available...
deployment "rancher" successfully rolled out
```

#### Verify that the Rancher Server is Successfully Deployed

After adding the secrets, check if Rancher was rolled out successfully:

```bash
kubectl -n cattle-system rollout status deploy/rancher
Waiting for deployment "rancher" rollout to finish: 0 of 3 updated replicas are available...
deployment "rancher" successfully rolled out
```

If you see the following **`error: error: deployment "rancher" exceeded its progress deadline`**, you can check the status of the deployment by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl -n cattle-system get deploy rancher
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
rancher   3         3         3            3           3m
```

It should show the same count for **`DESIRED`** and **`AVAILABLE`**.

#### Save Your Options

Make sure you save the **`--set`** options you used. You will need to use the same options when you upgrade Rancher to new versions with Helm.

#### Finishing Up

That’s it. You should have a functional Rancher server.

In a web browser, go to the DNS name that forwards traffic to your load balancer. Then you should be greeted by the colorful login page.
