# @openreplay/react-native

Only iOS devices are supported right now. Regular View and empty callbacks are used for android devices,
so its safe to use with crossplatform apps.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @openreplay/react-native
```

## Usage

```js
import { RntrackerView } from "@openreplay/react-native";

// ...

<RntrackerView color="tomato" />
```
