# @openreplay/react-native

Only iOS devices are supported right now. Regular View and empty callbacks are used for android devices,
so its safe to use with crossplatform apps.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @openreplay/react-native
```

Please see [the documentation](https://docs.openreplay.com/en/rn-sdk/) for more information about usage.
