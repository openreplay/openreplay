# OpenReplay Tracker Axios plugin

Tracker plugin to support tracking of the [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) requests.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @openreplay/tracker-axios
```

## Usage

Initialize the `@openreplay/tracker` package as usual and load the plugin into it.

```js
import Tracker from '@openreplay/tracker';
import trackerAxios from '@openreplay/tracker-axios';

const tracker = new Tracker({
  projectKey: YOUR_PROJECT_KEY,
});
tracker.start();

tracker.use(trackerAxios({ /* options here*/ }));
```
Options:

```ts
{
	instance: AxiosInstance;                       // default: axios
  failuresOnly: boolean;                         // default: false
  captureWhen: (AxiosRequestConfig) => boolean;  // default: () => true
  sessionTokenHeader: string;                    // default: undefined
  ingoreHeaders: Array<string> | boolean,        // default [ 'Cookie', 'Set-Cookie', 'Authorization' ]
}
```
By default plugin connects to the static `axios` instance, but you can specify one with the `instance` option.

Set `failuresOnly` option to `true` if you want to record only failed requests, when the axios' promise is rejected. You can also [regulate](https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config) axios failing behaviour with the `validateStatus` option.

`captureWhen` parameter allows you to set a filter on what should be captured. The function will be called with the axios config object and expected to return `true` or `false`.

In case you use [OpenReplay integrations (sentry, bugsnag or others)](https://docs.openreplay.com/integrations), you can use `sessionTokenHeader` option to specify the header name. This header will be appended automatically to the each axios request and will contain OpenReplay session identificator value.

You can define list of headers that you don't want to capture with the `ingoreHeaders` options. Set its value to `false` if you want to catch them all (`true` if opposite). By default plugin ignores the list of headers that might be sensetive such as `[ 'Cookie', 'Set-Cookie', 'Authorization' ]`.
